### Requirements
You can install the required packages with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Evaluation
You can evaluate Qwen2.5/Qwen2-Math-Instruct series model with the following command:
```bash
# Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct Series
PROMPT_TYPE="qwen25-math-cot"
# Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH


# Qwen2-Math-Instruct Series
PROMPT_TYPE="qwen-boxed"
# Qwen2-Math-1.5B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2-Math-1.5B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH
```
